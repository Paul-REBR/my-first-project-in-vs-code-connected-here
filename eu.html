   <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most beautiful place for me is Spain. When I was eleven years old, my mother and I first

went abroad. Mom and I both love to travel. Before that we visited several neighboring countries

that were part of the USSR, because we do not need a visa to travel there. Those countries are

almost the same as my Kazakhstan, everywhere people understand the Russian language,

architecture and lifestyle in them the same. But I knew that in Spain, everything will be different.

Before the flight, think a lot about Spain and trying to imagine it, I was a little scared. But

looking at my mother, I was happier, because it is not terrible, on the contrary she would quickly

fly there.

Arrived in Spain, I was amazed the splendor of the entire subject there. Everything was so

different compared to my country and people, starting with a huge beautiful airport and ending

roadside cafes. People seemed to me more relaxed and happy. All the people dressed decently

and in good taste, even if they were going to buy some bread. They were smiled, not even

familiar people. Their at once I saw a drunk people, they did not do anything wrong as do drunk

people in my country, they sat together in silence and watched the sunset. At that moment for the

first time in my life I really felt civilization.

My mother loves all sorts of excursions, and so in every country in every city we go on an excursion. early childhood I was bored and I did not understand why they need it, but now I am very grateful to my mother that I learned a little more. History and architecture is striking in its beauty and splendor of old times. Walking around the city, creates a sense of transfer time in the past.
